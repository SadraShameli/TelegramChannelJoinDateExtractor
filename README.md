## Telegram Channel Join Date Extractor

- This script will help you to figure out when you join a channel in your telegram account.
- You will be asked to login to your telegram account. The login session will be stored so you don't have to login the next time.
- The extracted dates will be saved inside the folder **"dates/"** with the following formatting for the filename:<br>
  `{%d %b, %Y - %H.%M}.txt`

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to create a telegram application and provide your API ID and API Hash inside a .env file.<br>
> This can be done by following the steps as outlined here: [core.telegram.org](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id)
