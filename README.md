## Telegram Channel Join Date Extractor

- This script will help you to figure out when you join a channel in your telegram account.
- You can manually add other fields if you need more information about every channel.
- You will be asked to login to your telegram account. The login session will be stored so you don't have to login the next time.
- The extracted data will be saved inside the folder **"data/"** with the following formatting for the filename:<br>
  `{%d %b, %Y - %H.%M}.(txt|csv)`

> [!IMPORTANT]
